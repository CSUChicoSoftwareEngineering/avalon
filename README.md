Team Avalon(Slider Widget):
This repo contains the slider widget for Bossy UI.
The goal of Bossy UI is to create free and open source web widgets with AngularJS that do not utilise any JQuery.
Bossy widgets are designed to be simple to manage, create, and use while also having minimal dependancies.


ROADMAP:
bossy.slider.js
   -This is the main project file which defines the slider and its functionality.

test.html
   -HTML testing file to allow for simple and manual testing of features in development.

karmaconf.js
   -Configuration file for karma. Defines settings such as which browsers to run tests through.
   
test/
   -holds angular js library and tests.
   -main.js is the Jasmine tests file.
   
node_modules/
   -holds testing frameworks (generally not edited)

About Testing:
Karma, Jasmine, Nodejs, and Gulp are the software suites used to manage and run tests.
Nodejs is used to install and run karma. (Note: Gulp will likely be used to run the tests in the future to consolidate testing over all widgets in Bossy)
Tests are written in Jasmine and located in the test folder's main.js file.
