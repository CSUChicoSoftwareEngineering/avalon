Team Avalon(Slider Widget):
This repo contains the slider widget for Bossy UI.
The goal of Bossy UI is to create a library of free and open source web widgets with AngularJS that do not utilize any JQuery.
Bossy widgets are designed to be simple to manage, create, and use, while also having minimal dependencies.
 
 
ROADMAP:
bossy.slider.js
   -This is the main project file which defines the slider and its functionality.
 
test.html
   -HTML testing file to allow for simple and manual testing of features in development.
   -Also doubles as a set of examples for how to instantiate the slider and various	options
 
karmaconf.js
   -Configuration file for Karma. Defines settings such as which browsers to run tests through.
  
test/
   -Holds AngularJS library and tests.
   -main.js is the Jasmine tests file. Additional test cases are added here.

About Testing:
