Team Avalon:
We will make widgets for AngularJS that do not utilise any JQuery.
We will use GitHub for version control and to manage our project.

Team Introductions:

I am Taber Storm Fitzgerald, and I am A junior in college with little GitHub experience and have dabbled in several languages such as C++ C# Java HTML CSS JS and love run on sentances.

I am James Crean, a senior in the Computer Science department with background in mostly C/C++. My skype name is goldennut (not joking), feel free to add me so we can chat about the project.
