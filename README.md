Team Avalon:
We will make widgets for AngularJS that do not utilise any JQuery.
We will use GitHub to create version control and manage our project.

I am Taber Storm Fitzgerald, and I am A junior in college with little GitHub experience and have dabbled in several languages such as C++ C# Java HTML CSS JS and love run on sentances.
