Team Avalon:
We will make widgets for AngularJS that do not utilise any JQuery.
We will use GitHub for version control and to manage our project.

Coding requirements:
It has been decided to keep braces for fuctions to begin on a new line. EX.
   func()
   {
   }
It has been decided to use three spaces per indent. EX.
   func()
   {
      int++;
   }
It has been decided to have more talk about this... EX.
   As in human talking. ;)
